## Introduction

Flarekit simplifies the complexities of building interconnected apps for **[Cloudflare Infrastructure](https://developers.cloudflare.com/)**. While Cloudflare provides excellent production-ready tools, local development and testing often pose challenges. Flarekit addresses this by providing:

- Predefined commands for managing apps and databases.
- Integrated developer tools like **[ESLint](https://eslint.org/)**, **[Prettier](https://prettier.io/)**, and examples using **[Astro](https://astro.build/)** (frontend) and **[Hono](https://hono.dev/)** (backend).
- Shared infrastructure setup supporting **[D1 databases](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/)**, **[R2 storage](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/)**, and **[Queues](https://developers.cloudflare.com/queues/)** for seamless local and production environments.

By enabling an edge-first development model, Flarekit ensures developers can create scalable, maintainable, and testable applications for Cloudflare.

## Project Structure

The monorepo is organized as follows:

```
flarekit/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ apps/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backend/   # Backend services
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ web/       # Frontend application
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ packages/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ database/  # Shared database layer
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scripts/       # Utility scripts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .github/       # GitHub Actions workflows
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ turbo.json     # TurboRepo configuration
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json   # Root package manager configuration
```

- **apps/backend**: Cloudflare Worker API built with **[Hono](https://hono.dev/)**.
- **apps/web**: Frontend application using **[Astro](https://astro.build/)**.
- **packages/database**: Centralized database layer with **[D1](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/)** and **[Drizzle ORM](https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-orm)**.

## Prerequisites

Ensure the following tools are installed:

- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)**: v18 or higher
- **[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)**: Latest version

---

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Atyantik/flarekit.git
   cd flarekit
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the Development Environment**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   **[TurboRepo](https://turbo.build/)** ensures all apps and services start seamlessly.

## Development

### Backend Development

```bash
npx flarekit dev --filter="@flarekit/backend"
```

### Frontend Development

```bash
npx flarekit dev --filter="@flarekit/web"
```

---

## Testing

### Run Unit Tests

```bash
npm test
```

### Run End-to-End Tests (Playwright)

```bash
npx playwright install && npm run test:e2e
```

---

## Deployment

### Automated Deployment (GitHub Actions)

Flarekit leverages **[GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)** for automated deployments:

1. Linting and testing ensure code quality.
2. Builds separate deployable applications for backend and frontend.
3. Deploys to Cloudflare environments using **[Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/cli-wrangler/)**.

### Manual Deployment

In cases where manual deployment is necessary:

1. Run linting:

   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```

2. Build applications:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. Run tests:

   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

4. Deploy database migrations:

   ```bash
   CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=<token> CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=<account_id> npx flarekit migrate:d1:production
   ```

5. Deploy frontend:

   ```bash
   cd apps/web
   CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=<token> CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=<account_id> npx wrangler pages deploy ./dist
   cd ../..
   ```

6. Deploy backend:

   ```bash
   cd apps/backend
   CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=<token> CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=<account_id> npx wrangler deploy
   cd ../..
   ```

## Working with Database Services

The database package (`@flarekit/database`) is a lightweight library built with **[Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/)**, ensuring compatibility with all monorepo apps.

### Why Drizzle ORM?

**[Drizzle ORM](https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-orm)** is edge-deployable, making it ideal for Cloudflare‚Äôs infrastructure. Avoid non-edge-compatible ORMs.

### Creating a Schema

Define a schema in `packages/database/src/schema`:

```typescript
import { sqliteTable, text } from 'drizzle-orm/sqlite-core';
import { sql } from 'drizzle-orm';

export const userSchema = sqliteTable('users', {
  id: text('id').primaryKey(),
  name: text('name').notNull(),
  email: text('email').notNull(),
  createdAt: text('created_at').default(sql`(current_timestamp)`),
});
```

### Generating Migrations

Generate migrations:

```bash
npx flarekit build:migrations
```

### Applying Local Migrations

Run migrations locally:

```bash
npx flarekit migrate:d1:local
```
